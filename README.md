## 👨‍🏫 How to use
The person responsible for the live transmission opens up the Receiver page, chromakeys the green-box and adjusts it to fit their needs, then waits on the Translator operating the Sender page.

The Translator opens the Sender page and types their translation in the text area; every time the enter key is pressed, the current message is sent to the Receiver page, as well as showing up on the immediate feedback just above the type area.

## ⚙ How it works
Live-Translation was made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python modules:
- Flask;
- Flask_SocketIO for WebSockets;
- Jinja for web template.
